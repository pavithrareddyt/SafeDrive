SAFE DRIVE
        -DRIVER DROWSINESS DETECTION SYSTEM
This project implements a Driver Drowsiness Detection System using computer vision techniques. It monitors the driver's facial features in real-time to detect signs of drowsiness such as prolonged eye closure or yawning and issues an alert to prevent accidents.

FEATURES :- 
Real-time detection of eyes and mouth using Haar Cascades.
Alerts when:
Eyes are closed for a prolonged period.
Mouth is open continuously (indicative of yawning).
Uses webcam input for live monitoring.
Audio alarm for immediate warning.

TECHNOLOGIES USED :-
Python
OpenCV
Haar Cascade Classifiers
NumPy
Playsound (for alarm)
Matplotlib (for visualization)

WORKING :-
Captures video from your webcam.
Detects facial landmarks using Haar cascades.
Counts frames with closed eyes or open mouth.
Triggers an alarm if drowsiness signs are detected consistently.
